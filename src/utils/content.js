      "The sample documents are text from the front page of the 94 editions of the 1850s paper <i> <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href = 'https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026752/'>The National Era</a></i> (Library of Congress, n.d.). was a newspaper that ran from January 1850 to March 1860, the years leading up to the American Civil War. What makes <i>The National Era</i> unique is that it was one of the first African American newspapers in the country. It was produced in an era where racial identity came with devastating implications, and abolitionism was centerstage in American politics. These particular documents were randomly chosen to provide a representative sample of the paper’s front page during that decade. ",

    text:
      "Another thing you’ll notice about the text is that it’s far from perfect. Indeed, for some documents, the jumble of letters can be rather disorienting. This is because the files were produced automatically (by a computer) from images. That is, each file is a computer’s “reading” of an image through a process called optical character recognition (OCR). Some pages are better than others, owing to variable image quality and the specifics of the OCR process. This leads us to question - where did these files come from? ",

Chronicling America provides OCR readings of many of its documents, though quality is hugely variable. OCR for The National Era is quite good compared to other newspapers, despite the mess of characters you’ll see for some documents. This database is publicly accessible and provides a huge number of resources for both personal and academic inquiry. However, it’s worth considering why one should be skeptical about relying on OCR quality as a basis for research.",

      "Unsurprisingly, these newspapers were less frequently successful than their white counterparts, owing to a smaller and less well-off readership. Many “penny papers” of the era took a “race to the bottom” approach, seeking to minimize costs and sell to the largest audience at the lowest price possible. In contrast, the Era prided itself on its physical size and quality, “printed on a mammoth sheet, of the finest quality, in handsome type,” and asked a hefty two dollars per year for a subscription, a steep price for a weekly paper (Accessible Archives, n.d.).",

While other African American newspapers have been documented in databases like (ironically) <i>Accessible Archives</i>,  they are not publicly available, making them difficult to research and discuss. <i>Chronicling America</i>, meanwhile, features a broad and accessible collection of predominantly white newspapers. This underrepresentation of African American newspapers contributes greatly to what many scholars identify as a gap in the literature that fails to incorporate African American voices into print and literature studies (Cohen et al., 2012; 2). Moreover, because literature and books tend to take precedence over news media in print studies, newspapers like the <i>Era</i>, which favored current events over literary pieces, are effectively silenced.

    text:
      "Indeed, some surveys of antebellum newspapers overlook the force of abolitionism altogether. Analysis of the era, of course, does not necessarily have to be limited to an entirely presentist perspective centered around the impending Civil War. But ignoring the influence of abolitionism only perpetuates the silencing of African American perspectives in print. At the same time, the limited digitalization of these newspapers has been a barrier to scholars specifically interested in African American print culture. Instead, limited existing research on the Era includes mostly interpretations of the paper’s ideological foundations. This typically constitutes a specific discussion of the paper’s approach of gradual abolitionism, but fails to engage with the larger historical context (Krywicki, 2013).",

      "OK, so a lot just happened but, for now, focus on the map. You’ll notice that a number of circles have appeared on the map (a rather large number!). Each of these represents one geographic entity (a place) - i.e. a city (blue) or a state (red). You can find more information about an individual place by clicking on its associated circle. The area of the circle is proportional to how many times its corresponding place was mentioned in your collection of documents. For example, you’ll notice that the largest circle on the map corresponds with York, in England - meaning that the app has identified the most mentions associated with York. You might already get the sense that something’s not right - we’ll get back to that in a minute.",

      "In order to tidy things up a bit, you can navigate to the <i>Map Controls</i> section of the sidebar. Setting a threshold is one of the easiest things you can do to make the map easier to read.. This threshold will filter out any results that do not constitute X% of all mentions. Even a very small threshold (<0.5%) will clear up much of the noise on the map and allow you to focus on more frequently mentioned entities. You can also set a population threshold, which omits cities with a modern population less than the value provided.",

      "In addition to the many other options in this panel, it can be very useful to apply a date filter in order to view change over time. For example, if you set the range from 1850-1853 and drag the selection to the right, you can see the explosion of mentions of Kansas in the latter half of the decade, going from zero mentions in the former period, to 121 in ‘55-’58 (5.4% of all place names). Selecting “group by state” includes all Kansas cities in this number and similarly supports this trend. In contrast, notice the sharp decline in mentions for Texas after 1850, going from 37 in a year (4.2%) to just 20 in the next five years combined (0.2%).",

      "It is no coincidence that these five years were the same period that put Kansas, Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska (literally) on the map. After the 1845 US annexation of Texas, the <i>Era</i>’s attention began to turn toward the changing midwest. The 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act and subsequent violent confrontations known as “Bleeding Kansas” rocked the region, and as an African American abolitionist paper, the <i>Era</i> seemingly shifted in its perception of the battleground of slavery. Indeed, the <i>Era</i>’s content, consisting of “Current Events, Congressional Proceedings, [and] General Politics,” suggests that this represents a large scale geographic shift of the abolitionist interpretation of current events, refocusing from the south and west to the midwest (Accessible Archives, n.d.).",

    title: "Geocoding",
    text:
      "You might be surprised that a Washington, D.C. newspaper mentions York, England more than anywhere in the US. Indeed, you would be right to be skeptical. This result exposes part of the process of translating files into geographic data. After performing OCR to extract text from images, one must “geocode” that text. That is, one must scan the text for words that resemble place names, then determine which particular place they refer to. Much like OCR, this process has its limitations.",

      "In order to geocode the text, this app uses a data set derived from the <i><a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href = 'https://www.geonames.org/about.html'>Geonames</a></i> database. <i>Geonames</i> attempts to catalog information about every geographic entity in the world, including millions of names in hundreds of languages. Scrape the Past uses a limited subset of the database, which includes only US states, countries, and cities with a modern population over 15,000. You can also enable the use of alternate names for places (under <i>Overrides</i>). For example, Washington D.C. might instead be called “Washington City,” and <i>Geonames</i>, amusingly, lists “The D” as an alternate name for Detroit.  (Geonames, n.d.)",

This app reconciles such ambiguity by defaulting to the place with the higher population. However, places like Kansas City pose a different problem. Notice that, if you click on its associated circle it lists the literal phrase associated with each identification of a placename. Kansas City is identified only by the phrases “milton” and “greenwood,” which means <i>Geonames</i> likely has these listed as alternate names. While alternate names are a useful tools in some cases for catching references that might otherwise be missed, they should be used with caution!<br/><i>Note: You can disable the use of alternate names under Overrides</i>",

    title: "Overriding",

      "Once again, turn your attention to York, England. It is a decent bet that these instances are, for the most part, actually broken up mentions of New York. One way to fix this is by navigating to the “Overrides” panel of the sidebar. Under “Manual Phrases,” enter “york” as phrase and “new york” as place (these fields are not case sensitive). Clicking “add” will then re-associate all instances of “york” to the entity currently identified by “new york” - the state, in this case. You can use any phrase, even one which is not a place-name. Another likely desirable override is to re-associate “washington” from the state to the city, “washington dc.” <br/><br/> <i> Note: Be careful when applying overrides, as it can take a long time to update analysis after applying the changes. It’s probably better to make these updates before loading a large dataset.</i>",

    text:
      "However, this first approach has its problems. Assuming that all “york” mentions actually intend to mean “new york” is innocuous enough, but consider how this might skew results toward favoring New York over other cities. For example, Des Moines and Little Rock are probably broken up fairly frequently - consider how including “york” but not “moines” or “rock” might skew our results (you can experiment with adding both of these). Instead, the better approach is probably to resolve ambiguity by removing “york” altogether. You can do this by adding it to <i>Blacklist</i> below.",

      "Another solution for clearing up questionable mentions is to rely on a whitelist. Notice that while the <i>Whitelist</i> table already has entries, it is not enabled. Go ahead and check that box (it will take a while to refresh the geocoding). A whitelist will restrict analysis to places specifically enumerated in the table. In this case, the default whitelist contains the 200 most populated US cities (by modern counts), as well as all US states. This is the method that much academic research uses (Blevins, 2014).",

However, there remains a large set of papers that simply have not survived, are not digitized, or are not publicly available.
