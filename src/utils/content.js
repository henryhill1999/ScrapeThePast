      "The sample documents are text from the front page of the 94 editions of the 1850s paper <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href = 'https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026752/'>The National Era</a> (Library of Congress, n.d.). The National Era was a newspaper that ran from January 1850 to March 1860, the years leading up to the American Civil War. What makes The National Era unique is that it was one of the first African American newspapers, produced in an era where racial identity came with devastating implications, and abolitionism was centerstage in American politics. These particular documents were randomly chosen to provide a representative sample of the paper’s front page during that decade. ",

    title: "About OCR",
    text:
      "Another thing you’ll notice about the text is that it’s far from perfect. Indeed, for some documents, the jumble of letters can be rather disorienting. This is because the files were produced automatically (by a computer) from images. That is, each file is a computer’s “reading” of an image, through a process that is called optical character recognition (OCR). Some pages are better than others, owing to variable image quality and the specifics of the OCR process. This leads us to question - where did these files come from?",

Chronicling America provides OCR readings of many of its documents, though quality is hugely variable. It happens that OCR for The National Era is quite good, compared to other newspapers, despite the mess of characters you’ll see for some documents. This database is publicly accessible and provides a huge number of resources for both personal and academic inquiry. However, it’s worth considering why one should be skeptical about relying on OCR quality as a basis for research. ",

      "These newspapers, unsurprisingly were less frequently successful that their white counterparts, owing to a smaller and less well-off readership. Many “penny papers” of the era took a “race to the bottom” approach, seeking to minimize costs and sell to the largest audience at the lowest price possible. In contrast, the Era prided itself on its physical size and quality, “printed on a mammoth sheet, of the finest quality, in handsome type,”and asked a hefty two dollars per year for a subscription, a steep price for a weekly paper (Accessible Archives, n.d.).",

    text:
      "The paper’s success as a national voice of abolitionism among a well-off audience made it an exception to the rule of African-American newspapers at the time, and highlights the relative absence of other, less successful papers of the time from Chronicling America. While other examples of African American newspapers exist, for example in the Accessible Archives database, their lack of public availability makes them difficult to research and discuss, leaving them underrepresented, compared to the vast corpus of white newspapers available at sites like Chronicling America.  In effect, this contributes greatly to what many scholars identify as a gap in the literature that fails to incorporate African American voices into print and literature studies (Cohen et al., 2012; 2). Moreover, it reflects the overriding trend in print studies of privileging literature and books over news media, specifically silencing newspapers such as the Era that favor current events over literary pieces.",

  {
    title: "Silences in the literature",
    text:
      "Indeed, some surveys of antebellum newspapers overlook the force of abolitionism altogether. Though one need not view the period from an entirely presentist perspective centered around the impending Civil War, ignoring the elephant in the room merely perpetuates the silencing of African American perspectives in print. At the same time, the limited digitalization of these newspapers has reduced the ability of scholars specifically interested in African American print culture to study it. Instead, limited existing research on the Era includes mostly interpretations of the paper’s ideological foundations, centered around gradual abolitionism, based on a methodology of close reading (Krywicki, 2013).",

    title: "Reading the map",
    text:
      "OK, so a lot just happened, but most important is the map. Everything else is based around the map. You’ll notice that a number of circles have appeared on the map (a rather large number!). Each of these represents one geographic entity (a place) - i.e. a city (blue) or a state (red). You can find more information about individual places by clicking on their associated circle. The area of the circle is proportional to how many times its corresponding place was mentioned in your collection of documents. For example, you’ll notice that the largest circle on the map corresponds with Warner Robins, Georgia - meaning that the app has identified the most mentions associated with Warner Robins. We’ll get back to that in a minute.",

    title: "Controlling the map",
    text:
      "In order to tidy things up a bit, you can navigate to the “Map Controls” section of the sidebar (drag the horizontal dividers to change the size of different sections). One of the easiest things to make the map easier to read is to set a threshold. This threshold will filter out any results that do not constitute X% of all mentions. Even a very small threshold (<0.5%) will clear up much of the noise on the map and allow one to focus on more frequently mentioned entities.",

    title: "Controlling the map (cont.)",
    text:
      "In addition to the many other options in this panels, it can be very useful to apply a date filter, in order to view change over time. For example, if you set the range from 1850-1853 and drag the selection to the right, you can see the explosion of mentions of Kansas in the latter half of the decade, going from zero mentions in the former period, to 121 in ‘55-’58 (5.4% of all placenames). Selecting “group by state” includes all Kansas cities in this number and similarly supports this trend. In contrast, notice the sharp decline in mentions for Texas after 1850, going from 37 in a year (4.2%) to just 20 in the next five years combined (0.2%).",

  {
    title: "Interpreting frequency",
    text:
      "It is no coincidence that these five years were the same that put Kansas, Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska (literally) on the map. In the wake of the US annexation of Texas in 1845, this period saw a sharp decline in the newspaper’s attention toward the new state, in favor of the midwest/plains region. As an African-American abolitionist paper, one might detect a shift in the Era’s perceived battleground of slavery, culminating in the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act and subsequent violent confrontations known as “Bleeding Kansas.” Indeed, the Era’s content, consisting of “Current Events, Congressional Proceedings, [and] General Politics” suggests that this represents a large scale geographic shift of the abolitionist interpretation of current events, refocusing from the south and west to the midwest (Accessible Archives, n.d.).",

    title: "Geocoding",
    text:
      "You might be surprised that a Washington, D.C. newspaper mentions a town in Georgia more than anywhere else in the country. Indeed, you would be right to be skeptical. This result exposes part of the process of translating files into geographic data. After performing OCR to extract text from images, one must “geocode” that text. That is, one must scan the text for words that resemble place names, then determine which particular place they refer too. Much like OCR, this process has its limitations.",

      "In order to geocode the text, this app uses a data set derived from the Geonames database. Geonames attempts to catalog information about every geographic entity in the world, cataloging millions of names in hundred of languages. For this project, I have derived a limited subset of the database, which includes only US states and US cities with a population over 15,000, as well as their associated alternate names. For example, Washington D.C. might instead be called “Washington City,” and Geonames, amusingly, lists “The D” as an alternate name for Detroit, (Geonames, n.d.).",

    title: "Geonames (cont.)",
    text:
      "The app is only as good as its data and it is worth noting the shortcomings of this method of geocoding. Not only may a city have multiple names, but multiple cities may have the same name. This app reconciles such ambiguity by defaulting to the place with the higher population. However, places like Warner Robins, Georgia pose a different problem. Notice that, if you click on its associated circle (the big one!) it lists the literal phrase which was associated with each identification of a placename. Tellingly, Warner Robins has been identified via the phrase “York,” which Geonames identifies as an alternate name.",

    title: "Overriding",

      "It is a decent bet that these instances are, for the most part, actually broken up mentions of New York. We can fix this by navigating to the “Overrides” panel of the sidebar. Under “Re-associations,” enter “york” for “from” and “new york” for “to” (these fields are not case sensitive). Clicking “add” will then re-associate all instances of “york” to the entity currently identified by “new york” - the state, in this case. Another probably desirable override is to re-associate “washington” from the state to the city, “washington dc.”",

      "Taken together, this non-comprehensive list of strategies and tools shows the potential of this software for understanding large collections of text which would otherwise be too big for such analysis, a technique that has gained increasing popularity in the field of digital history, but is seldom employed by non-academics (Blevins, 2014; ). This app is by no means the only tool of its kind. However, it is the only tool that I know of that is online and free-to-use, requiring no installation of specialized, complicated, or expensive software. ",

The incredible flexibility that this app provides opens up the possibility not only for expanding the understanding of well-kept databases, but also allows the use of OCR to uncover the significance of previously neglected resources. However, there remains a large set of papers that simply have not survived are not digitized, or are not publicly available. Many may never be - African American and other minority newspapers will likely never reach the same accessibility as their white counterparts.",
